# Speedcubing Algorithms

A collection of speedcubing algorithms and notes.

## Methods

Currently focusing on CFOP, but planning to expand to other methods.

### CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL)

The most popular speedcubing method that solves the cube in four steps:

- **Cross**: Form a plus sign on the bottom face
- **F2L**: First Two Layers - 42 algorithms to solve corner-edge pairs
- **OLL**: Orient Last Layer - 57 algorithms to orient the top face
- **PLL**: Permute Last Layer - 21 algorithms to position pieces correctly
